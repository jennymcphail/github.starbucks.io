## How can Starbucks use data to inform their marketing strategy?

As my first "proper" job was in marketing, I was interested to see how campaign strategy could be influenced using data, using techniques I have learned during my Data Science Nano Degree.

My gut feel is that a combination of campaign attributes and customer attributes influences how successful a marketing strategy is, but does the data support this?
